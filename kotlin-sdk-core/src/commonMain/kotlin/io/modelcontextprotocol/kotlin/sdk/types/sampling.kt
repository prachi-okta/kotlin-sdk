 * Because LLMs can vary along multiple dimensions, choosing the "best" model is rarely straightforward.
 * Different models excel in different areas—some are faster but less capable, others are more capable
 * but more expensive, and so on. This interface allows servers to express their priorities across
 * multiple dimensions to help clients make an appropriate selection for their use case.
 *
 * **Important:** These preferences are always advisory. The client MAY ignore them completely.
 * It is also up to the client to decide how to interpret these preferences and how to balance
 * them against other considerations.
 *
 * @property hints Optional hints to use for model selection.
 * If multiple hints are specified, the client MUST evaluate them in order
 * (such that the first match is taken).
 * The client SHOULD prioritize these hints over the numeric priorities,
 * but MAY still use the priorities to select from ambiguous matches.
 * @property costPriority How much to prioritize cost when selecting a model.
 * A value of 0.0 means cost is not important, while a value of 1.0 means
 * cost is the most important factor.
 * Should be between 0.0 and 1.0.
 * @property speedPriority How much to prioritize sampling speed (latency) when selecting a model.
 * A value of 0.0 means speed is not important, while a value of 1.0 means
 * speed is the most important factor.
 * Should be between 0.0 and 1.0.
 * @property intelligencePriority How much to prioritize intelligence and capabilities when selecting a model.
 * A value of 0.0 means intelligence is not important, while a value of 1.0
 * means intelligence is the most important factor.
